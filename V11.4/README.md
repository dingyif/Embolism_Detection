+ v11: weak emb + (strong emb + noise): haven't combine CNN results that try to separate strong emb from noise in google drive


+ v11.4: v11+resize(for stem only) (resize param: by Diane)
if use version below 11.4 and with resize = TRUE, you'll use parameters tuned by Dingyi

+ v12 (in google drive, not in github): weak emb + (strong emb + less noise) 
 	combine results obtained from CNN that separates strong emb from noise
